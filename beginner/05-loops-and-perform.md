# Lesson 5: Loops with PERFORM

`PERFORM` is used for repeating logic.

## Common loop

- `PERFORM UNTIL condition`

Example idea:

- Start counter at 1.
- Display counter.
- Add 1 each loop.
- Stop when counter > 5.

## Try this

- Print from 1 to 10.
- Print only even numbers.
- Add total sum of 1..5 in another variable.
