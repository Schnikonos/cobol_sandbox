# Lesson 3: ACCEPT + DISPLAY

Use `ACCEPT` to read from keyboard and `DISPLAY` to print.

## Pattern

- Prompt the user with `DISPLAY`.
- Read into a variable with `ACCEPT`.
- Show result.

## Notes

- `ACCEPT` reads a full line of text.
- For numeric fields, ensure your input is numeric.

## Try this

- Ask for first name and last name separately.
- Ask for age, then display: `You are XX years old`.
